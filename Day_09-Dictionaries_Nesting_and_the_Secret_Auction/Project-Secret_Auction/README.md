# Day 9: Silent Auction

## Description:
    This program simulates a silent auction where multiple users can input their bids anonymously. At the end of the auction, the program determines and announces the highest bidder.

## Objective:
    To practice working on Python dictionaries, user input, and basic program flor for managing data dynamically

## Skills Practiced:
  * Dictionaries: Used for storing bidder names and thier respective bids.
  * User Input: Collects and processes input dynamically for multiple users.
  * Control Flow: Uses loops and conditional logic to manage program execution.
  * Imports and lists: Imports list of bidding options 

## Expected Behavior:
    The program asks each user for their name and bid amount.
    When the bidding is completed and there are no more new bidders, the program calculates the highest bid and displays the corresponding bidder's name

## Example Run:
```plaintext
 Welcome to the Silent Auction!
Enter your name: Alice
Enter your bid: 150
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no': yes

Enter your name: Bob
Enter your bid: 200
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no': no

The winner is Bob with a bid of $200!
```

## Key Code Conceps:
  * **Dictionaries:** Used to store bidder data in a key-value format, with names as keys and bid amounts as values
  * **Loops and Conditions:** Controls the flow of the program by allowing users to enter multiple bids and handles the termination of input
  
## How to run:
```bash
python secret_auction.py
```

## What I learned:
    The practical use of dictionaries to manage data in a structured way
    How to handle user input dynamically for multiple users
    Implementing loops to process and update data iteratively
