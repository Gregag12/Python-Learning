# Title: Day 2 - Tip Generator

## Description:
    This simple program generates a tip based on user inputs. The program prompts the user to enter their total bill, a tip amount (10, 12, or 15), how many people are splitting the bill and then generates a tip amount

## Objective: To practice basic input and string manipulation in Python.

## Skills Practiced:
  * Mathmatical operations
  * Formatting output for currency

## Expected Behavior:
    The user is prompted to enter three pieces of information: the total bill, the desired tip percentage, and how many people will split the bill.
    The program then uses these inputs to generate a tip amount for each person.

## Example Run:
```
plaintext
What was the total bill?
37
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?
10
How many people are there to split the bill?
2
Each person should pay: $20.35
```

## Key Code Concepts:
  * **Input Function:** Uses input() to get user responses.
  * **Mathmatical Functions:** Uses addition, multiplication, division, and rounding to create an accurate tip amount.

## How to Run: Navigate to the folder for Day 2 and run the script:
```
bash
python tip_generator.py
```
## What I Learned: 
    This project helped me further understand basic user interaction in Python and how to use mathmatical functions to achieve a goal.
