# Title: Day 1 - Band Name Generator

## Description:
    This simple program generates a fun band name based on user inputs. The program prompts the user to enter the name of their city and pet, then combines these inputs to suggest a unique band name.

## Objective: 
    To practice basic input and string manipulation in Python.

## Skills Practiced:
  * Basic user input
  * String concatenation and formatting

## Expected Behavior:
  * The user is prompted to enter two pieces of information: the name of their city and the name of their pet.
  * The program combines these inputs to create a band name.

## Example Run:
```plaintext
What's the name of the city you grew up in? Seattle
What's your pet's name? Buddy
Your band name could be: Seattle Buddy
```

## Key Code Concepts:
  * **Input Function:** Uses input() to get user responses.
  * **String Concatenation:** Combines the two inputs to form a band name.

## How to Run: 
    Navigate to the folder for Day 1 and run the script:
```bash
python band_name_generator.py
```
## What I Learned: 
    This project helped me understand basic user interaction in Python and how to manipulate strings to create outputs based on user input.
