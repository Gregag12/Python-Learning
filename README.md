# Python-Learning
Welcome to my Python Learning Projects repository! This repository is a collection of projects and exercises completed as part of my journey to strengthen my Python skills, data analytics knowledge, and general programming abilities. Each project reflects my progress and learning in various Python topics, following the 100 Days of Coding: Python course on Udemy.

Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to:

Track my learning and development in Python.
Showcase my progress across different Python skills and topics.
Practice code documentation and version control through GitHub.
Repository Structure
Each folder contains projects, scripts, or exercises on specific topics or days from the course. Here’s the general structure of the repository:

```
.
├── Day 01 - Topic or Project Title
│   ├── Learning_Practice
|   |    ├── practice_name.py                # Main script file for the day's project
│   ├── Projects
|   |    ├── main_project.py                # Main script file for the day's project
|   |    ├── README.md                      # Summary of the project, key takeaways, and notes
├── Day 02 - Topic or Project Title
│   ├── Learning_Practice
|   |    ├── practice_name.py               
│   ├── Projects
|   |    ├── main_project.py                
|   |    ├── README.md                      
│   └── ...
└── Resources                                # Additional resources, links, and materials used
```

Each folder includes:

main.py: The primary code file for that day’s project.
README.md: A brief summary, describing the project, the Python concepts covered, and any notable learnings or challenges.
Topics Covered
Throughout these projects, I cover a range of Python and data analytics topics, including but not limited to:

Python fundamentals and syntax
Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)
Data processing and analysis
Basic data visualization
Working with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib
Object-oriented programming (OOP)
Web scraping and API usage
And much more!
How to Use This Repository
Feel free to explore any folder and review the code. If you’re also learning Python, you might find the comments and README files useful for understanding different concepts and problem-solving approaches.

Future Goals
As I continue to complete projects, I plan to:

Add more detailed documentation for each project.
Refactor code to improve readability and efficiency where possible.
Incorporate additional libraries and tools to expand my learning scope.
Connect with Me
I’m always open to feedback or connecting with others on similar learning paths! If you have suggestions, questions, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out.
