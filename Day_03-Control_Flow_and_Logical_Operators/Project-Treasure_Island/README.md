# Title: Day 3 - Treasue Island

## Description:
    An interactive text-based adventure game where the player makes choices to navigate through a fictional treasure island. Choices impact the path and determine whether they find the treasure or meet an unfortunate end!

## Objective: To practice if, else conditional operators in Python.

## Skills Practiced:
  * Control flow with if/else statements
  * Creating interactive text-based applications

## Expected Behavior:
    The user is prompted to enter a choice from the listed options (options depend on where they are in the game).
    The program then uses these inputs to generate an interactive adventure game.

## Example Run:
```
plaintext
Welcome to Treasure Island!
Your mission is to find the treasure...Good luck!
Following the trail into the jungle from the beach, you arrive at a cross road.Which road do you take?
Which road do you take? Type 'left' or 'right'.
left
You arrive at a large river with a weatherd looking dock. 
 Do you swim across or wait for a boat?
Type 'swim' or 'wait'.
swim
Something swims by your legs. It's a crocodile! 

 Game Over!
```

## Key Code Concepts:
  * **Input Function:** Uses input() to get user responses.
  * **Conditional Operator Functions:** Uses if, elif, else statements to create an adventure game where the makes choices.
  * **ASCII Characters:** How to use ASCII characters to display images in a text based program

## How to Run: Navigate to the folder for Day 2 and run the script:
```
bash
python treasure_island.py
```
## What I Learned: 
    This project helped me further understand user interaction in Python and how to use conditional operators to achieve a goal.
